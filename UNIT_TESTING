Unit-testing of mfile implemented using EUnit.

The testing framework consists of the following files and directories:
./src/test/
./src/test/mfile_test.erl
./src/test/mfilelib_tests.erl
./priv/static/dbinit-test.sh
./boss.test.config
./test

The last of these (./test) is the script for running the tests. Just run it.

The testing framework uses its own database, mfiletestdb. It is re-initialized 
every time the 'test' script is run, so the tests always start with a clean
slate.

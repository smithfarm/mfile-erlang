You have created a rogue subdirectory in ../src/controller (this is strictly *verboten*)
These messages appear when you start the server with a rogue directory present.

LESSON -- LOGGING:
To use lager (https://github.com/basho/lager) in your ChicagoBoss app, you
don't have do anything special: you don't have to put anything in the
boss.config file, nor do you need a -compile([{parse_transform,
lager_transform}]). line, nor do you have to do lager:start(). All of this is
done for you in the ChicagoBoss code. The lager configuration is located in
skel/boss.config under the ChicagoBoss directory. By default, the "info" and
"error" handlers are enabled. The log messages appear in the Erlang shell
(console) when you start the server using init-dev.sh, and they are also
written to the console.log and error.log files in the log directory of your
app.
